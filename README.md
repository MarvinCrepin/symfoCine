## Use/Examples

###  Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository using Git.
 Open up a terminal and
execute the following command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/MarvinCrepin/symfoCine
````

Next, move into the project and use Composer to download the application
dependencies:

```
$ cd symfoCine/
$ composer install
```

Make sure you [install Composer](http://getcomposer.org/download/) before
running this.

Usage
-----

If you have PHP 5.4 or higher, there is no need to configure a virtual host
in your web server to access the application. Just use the built-in web server:

```
$ cd symfoCine/
$ symfony serve
```

This will start a web server that's accessible at http://localhost:8000.
It will just sit and wait forever, so don't expect it to finish. You can
quit it later when you want by pressing `ctrl + c`.

> **NOTE**
>
> If you're using PHP 5.3, configure your web server to point at the `web/`
> directory of the project. For more details, see:
> http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/configuration/web_server_configuration.html

You're all done! Now just load up the application in your browser:

http://localhost:8000
